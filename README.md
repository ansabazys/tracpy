# Tracpy Platform

A scalable, event-driven **website analytics SaaS platform** designed to collect, process, and visualize website traffic data in real time.
The platform enables businesses to track visitor behavior, traffic sources, device usage, and performance metrics through a lightweight tracking script and a modern analytics dashboard.

This project demonstrates **production-grade full-stack architecture**, including event ingestion pipelines, analytics processing, microservices, and a multi-tenant SaaS system.

# Architecture Overview

The platform is built using a **modular microservice architecture** designed for scalability and high-volume event ingestion.

```
Client Website
      │
Tracking SDK
      │
Event Ingestion Service
      │
Event Queue / Stream
      │
Event Processor
      │
Analytics Database
      │
Analytics API
      │
Dashboard Application
```

Each component can scale independently to support high traffic workloads.

# Core Services

### Dashboard

Provides the user interface where website owners can view analytics insights, traffic trends, and visitor data.

### Ingestion Service

Handles incoming analytics events from client websites and pushes them into the processing pipeline.

### Analytics API

Serves processed analytics data to the dashboard with optimized queries.

### Event Processor

Processes queued events, performs aggregations, and prepares data for analytics queries.

### Authentication Service

Manages user authentication, authorization, and multi-tenant access control.

### Billing Service

Handles subscription plans, payment processing, and usage limits.

---

# Tracking Script Example

Websites can integrate analytics by embedding the tracking SDK.

```
<script src="https://cdn.analytics-saas.com/script.js"></script>
<script>
analytics.init("SITE_API_KEY")
</script>
```

This script sends visitor events to the ingestion service.
