# System Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of the Analytics SaaS platform.

The system is designed using a modular service-oriented architecture that supports scalable event ingestion, analytics processing, and real-time insights.

---

# Overview

The platform collects analytics events from client websites through a lightweight tracking script. These events are processed through an ingestion pipeline and stored in an analytics database where they can be queried and visualized through the dashboard.

# Core Components

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the frontend application that allows users to view analytics insights for their websites.

Responsibilities:

* Display traffic analytics
* Visualize visitor trends
* Show top pages and referrers
* Provide real-time analytics views

---

## Ingestion Service

The ingestion service receives analytics events from the client tracking script.

Responsibilities:

* Accept event payloads
* Validate incoming data
* Enrich metadata (IP, device, browser)
* Push events to the processing pipeline

---

## Event Processor

The event processor consumes queued events and performs aggregation tasks.

Responsibilities:

* Process raw events
* Aggregate analytics metrics
* Prepare analytics data for fast queries

---

## Analytics API

The analytics API serves analytics data to the dashboard.

Responsibilities:

* Query aggregated analytics data
* Provide filtered analytics metrics
* Serve real-time analytics endpoints

---

## Authentication Service

Handles user authentication and authorization.

Responsibilities:

* User registration and login
* Access control
* API security

---

# Scalability Considerations

The system is designed to support high traffic workloads by separating responsibilities into independent services.

Key strategies:

* Event queueing to handle spikes in traffic
* Background event processing
* Optimized analytics queries
* Service-level scaling
